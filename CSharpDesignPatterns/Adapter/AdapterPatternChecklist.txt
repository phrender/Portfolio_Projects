Adapter pattern checklist

[ ] - Identify all three actors in this pattern (Client, Adaptee and Adapter)
[ ] - Identify the interface that the client requires and put it in an abstract class
[ ] - Derive a concrete adapter class form the abstract target
[ ] - Write an adapter to map the client interface
[ ] - Modify the client to use the adapter every time it needs to access the adaptee
