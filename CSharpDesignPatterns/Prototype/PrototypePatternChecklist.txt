Prototype pattern checklist

[ ] - Make sure your objects have complex multi-step initialization and dirive from the same generic template
[ ] - Create an abstract prototype that celares a Clone method
[ ] - Create a concrete prototype that implements the Clone method
[ ] - Add a client that initializes the objects by starting a cloned prototype
[ ] - Make sure the calling code does not use new anywhere
