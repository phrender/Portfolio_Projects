Builder Pattern checklist

[ ] - Have lots of products that only differ in thier permutations and the construction code involves a number of sequential steps
[ ] - Create a concrete builder class for each product type
[ ] - Design a standard protocol for all build steps
[ ] - Define a directro that calls the builder methods in the correct order
[ ] - Make sure the client doesn't use new anywhere and only uses the builder to create new instances.
