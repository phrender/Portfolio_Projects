Proxy pattern checklist

[ ] - Identify the need for a proxy (lazy loading, remote access or access control)
[ ] - Define an interface that will make the proxy and the real object interchangeable
[ ] - Add proxy constrictor that recives and stores a reference to the real object
[ ] - Implement the proxy interface
[ ] - Make sure the client instantiates the proxy instead of a real object
