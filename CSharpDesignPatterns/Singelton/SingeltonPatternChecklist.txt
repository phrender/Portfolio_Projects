Singelton pattern checklist

[ ] - Make sure that no class can be the owner of the singelton instance
[ ] - Make sure you need lazy initialization
[ ] - Make sure there is no other alternative to provide global access to the singelton
[ ] - Define a Singelton class with a protected constructor
[ ] - Add a field member called instance
[ ] - Add a static property called Instance and use lazy initialization
[ ] - Change the calling conde to always use the Instance property to access the singelton
